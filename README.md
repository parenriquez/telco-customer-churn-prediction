#### **Telco Customer Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression**

#### **Abstract**

**Churn** is the movement of individuals OUT of a collective group over a specific period.

It is a good indicator of growth potential. It tracks lost customers, while growth tracks new customers. If churn is higher than growth, your business is getting smaller.

Low churn rate means happy customers – continuous flow of revenue, while high churn rate means customers are leaving you – revenue is compromised.

*Predicting churn* is a good way to create proactive marketing campaigns targeted at the customers that are about to churn.
If successful, it saves the company from unnecessary expenses, and protects revenue from depletion.

During churn prediction:

1. We identify *at-risk* customers
2. We identify strategies to lower churn and increase customer retention

Churn rate is very important in the telecommunications industry (prepaid and postpaid, wireless and cable, satellite and television, internet service providers, etc.). 
It is an integral part of Key Performance Indicators constantly monitored by providers on a quarterly or year on year basis.

It provides a clear picture on the state and quality of the business, shows customer satisfaction with their product or service, and allows for comparison with competitors to gauge customer turnover at the same timeframe.
